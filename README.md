This is an API server that is an excellent data warehouse.

Here's what the data storage scheme looks like:

Swagger has been added to Info-Keeper, so it will be easier to figure out how the API works.

Info-Keeper uses the most advanced and reliable data hashing and encryption algorithms. Because the main goal is to protect client data.

Data is transmitted and received using a key provided to the server by the client itself and a unique identifier generated by the server when the user transmits data. Such a key-id bundle practically guarantees that your key cannot be randomly selected randomly using various data generation mechanisms.

Welcome to the world of secure data! Welcome to the world of Info-Keeper!
